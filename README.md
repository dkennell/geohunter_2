# Geohunter
## Description

This app lets Geocachers share a record of the caches they've left in
the physical world so that others can have have fun finding them! Yay!

## Installation 

 - Clone the repo, and open two tabs in your terminal
 - In the first one, run:
   - bundle install
   - rake db:migrate
   - rake db:seed
   - rails s -p 3001
 - In the other, run:
   - cd client
   - npm start
 - You're all set! Point your browser at localhost:3000 to play with
 Geohunter!

## Things to do in Geohunter

- Sign up as a new user
- Create a cache
- Log in and out and in again! Whee!
- Take a look at the users and caches that are already on the site.
- Go to the coordinates! There are totally real caches there!
- Don't actually do that! Yay!
